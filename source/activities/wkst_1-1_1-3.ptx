                      For each of the following prompts, first try to construct an example (or decide that one cannot exist). Then reflect on what the question reveals about linear systems. Use vocabulary from the chapter in your reflections.

                        Which of these questions ask for a specific example, and which are really asking you to think about what <em>must</em> be true of certain kinds of linear systems? What properties distinguish homogeneous and nonhomogeneous systems?
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Is it possible for a linear system to have exactly three solutions? Why or why not?

                      <p>
                        Homogeneous systems by definition are linear expressions (like <m>ax+by</m>, without a constant term) set equal to zero. You can tell if a system is homogeneous by checking if setting all the variables equal to zero is a solution. This is because setting all the variables equal to zero makes the left size zero, and the only way for there to be an equality is if the right side is also zero.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Linear systems have one, zero, or infintely many solutions. This is a mathematical statement that we will prove later the course, but for right now, you can think about the way lines and planes can be arranged. A line can intersect another line at one point, or they can miss each other completely if they're parallel, or they can plot the exact same (infinitely many) points.

                        \vdots  \amp \vdots  \amp \ddots \amp \vdots  \\
                        a_{m, 1} \amp a_{m, 2} \amp \cdots \amp a_{m, n}

                This is a good time to review the definitions of matrix addition (<q>entrywise</q> is how people talk about this sometimes), scalar multiplication, and subtraction (a combination of addition and multiplication, if you like), and transposes. What does it mean to be a zero matrix from the point of view of matrix addition? Can a matrix have an additive inverse?
            </p>

            <theorem> 
                <title>Existence of the Additive Identity</title>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        The <m>m \times n</m> matrix of all zeros, <m>Z</m>, is the additive identity for the set of <m>m \times n</m> matrices.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        That is for each <m>A \in M_{m \times n}</m>,

                    <me>
                        A + Z = Z + A = A.
                    </me>
                </statement>

                <proof> 
                    <p>
                        Let <m>m, n</m> be positive integers. Assume <m> A \in M_{m\times n}</m>, and assume <m>Z \in M_{m \times n}</m> is the matrix of all zeros.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>
                          Try find a way to use the definition of addition to get to the end of the proof (the next line). Since matrix equality happens at the entry level, you will probably have define <m>A = [a_{i,j}]</m> and <m>Z = [z_{i,j}]</m> for all <m>1 \le i \le m</m>, <m>1 \le j \le n</m>, and note that <m>z_{i,j} = 0</m> for each entry. Now use the definition of addition: what is the <m>i,j</m>-th entry of <m>A+Z</m>?
                        </em>
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Therefore, <m>A + Z = Z + A = A</m>.
                    </p>
              </proof>
            </theorem>

            <p>
                Is <m>Z^T = Z</m>? How would you prove it?
                <br /><br />

                <em>Unless <m>Z</m> is square, <m>Z</m> and <m>Z^T</m> have different sizes so they can't be equal. If <m>Z</m> is square (same number of rows and columns), then <m>Z</m> and <m>Z^T</m> have the same sizes and the same entries (all zeros), so they are equal.</em>

                Once you work those questions out, talk about the defintion of <em>matrix multiplication</em>. That is, explain why the following is the definition; what is the point of defining matrix multiplication this way? Probably has something to do with linear systems, right?

  <title>Finishing the Proof of the Matrix–Vector Product Theorem</title>
    <statement>
        <p><alert>Turn-In!</alert></p>
      <p>
        The proof below is partially completed. Work together to finish it.
        Be explicit about where each definition is used.
      </p>

    <proof>
      <p>
        By the definition of matrix multiplication, the product
        <m>A\mathbf{x}</m> is an <m>m \times 1</m> matrix, and
      </p>

      <me>
        A\mathbf{x}
        =
        \begin{bmatrix}
          x_1 a_{1,1} \\
          x_1 a_{2,1} \\
          \vdots \\
          x_1 a_{m,1}
        \end{bmatrix}
        +
        \begin{bmatrix}
          x_2 a_{1,2} \\
          x_2 a_{2,2} \\
          \vdots \\
          x_2 a_{m,2}
        \end{bmatrix}
        + \cdots +
        \begin{bmatrix}
          x_n a_{1,n} \\
          x_n a_{2,n} \\
          \vdots \\
          x_n a_{m,n}
        \end{bmatrix}.
      </me>

      <p>
        Using the definition of matrix addition, this can be written as
      </p>

      <me>
        \sum_{i=1}^n
        \begin{bmatrix}
          x_i a_{1,i} \\
          x_i a_{2,i} \\
          \vdots \\
          x_i a_{m,i}
        \end{bmatrix}.
      </me>

      <p>
        By the definition of scalar multiplication, we may factor out
        <m>x_i</m> from each term, leaving <m>\mathrm{col}_i(A)</m>. Therefore,
        </p>

      <me>
        A\mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \mathrm{col}_i(A),

            I recommend trying them outside of class if you don't finish, though you don't need to turn them in.
