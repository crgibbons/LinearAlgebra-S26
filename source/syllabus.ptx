            <title>Course Description</title>
            <p>
              Linear Algebra is about how lots of lines and planes (and things that behave a lot like lines and planes) behave at the same time, and the types of mathematical operations that can be defined when you’re working with line-like or plane-like things. By the end of this course, you’ll be able to answer the following questions.

            <p>
              Much of the <b>Disciplinary Practice</b>, <b>Creativity</b>, and <b>Communication and Expression</b> within mathematics comes through the process of solving a problem/proving a proposition and then writing it up. In this class, you will develop proof writing skills to communicate math as a mathematician would.

      <p>
        This class is team-based, so you need to show up every day having completed the pre-class readings. Being physically present isn't enough---you need to show up ready to work!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is worth 10% of your course grade.

      <title>Teamwork</title>
      <p>
        Most weeks you will have a written homework assignment. These will give you an opportunity to write out proofs and solutions in the manner that you will be expected to on the exams. You will submit your solutions using Gradescope following instructions provided on Canvas. The questions on each written homework will be graded for correctness by the TAs and graders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collaborating with other students on the written homework is encouraged, but you must write up all reasoning and solutions on your own (in other words, no copying). Failure to abide by this guideline could be construed as a form of academic dishonesty.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this course is to develop your ability to understand and construct mathematical arguments or proofs. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools and applications (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Copilot, DALL-E, and others) for written homework does not support the learning objectives of this course and is prohibited. Using them in any way for written homework in this course is a violation of the course’s expectations and will be addressed through UW–Madison’s academic misconduct policy, specifically UWS 14.03(1)b (b) Uses unauthorized materials or fabricated data in any academic exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each problem on written homework should be completed with neat, understandable, detailed solutions and explanations. Your explanations and proofs must be sound and rigorous, paying attention to detail and clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Written homework is due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. It is worth 15% of your course grade. Late written homework will generally not be accepted. Since you likely will either experience a technical difficulty (e.g., missed the deadline, your computer shut down as you were submitting it, internet outage, etc.) or a personal emergency (being sick, attending a funeral, etc.) during the semester, the two lowest two written homework scores will be dropped. You do not need to contact your instructor or TA if such a situation does come up.

        Students must use the form provided on Blackboard to let me know of conflicts with the dates and times of the tests or final exam during the first two week of classes. Reports of conflicts will be reviewed. Submitting incorrect information in order to take a test or the final exam at a different time may be considered an act of academic misconduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        During exams, students will not be allowed to use any notes or electronic devices. Ample space will be provided on the exams for you to show your work. You must bring a writing utensil.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Added March 7, 2025</em>: If a student's overall course grade would increase by using their final exam score in place of the lower of their scores on Test I and Test II, they will receive the grade based on this alternative grade computation method.
