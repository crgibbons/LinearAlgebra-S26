            <title>Course Description</title>
            <p>
              Linear Algebra is about how lots of lines and planes (and things that generalize a lot of features of lines and planes) behave at the same time, and the types of mathematical operations that can be defined when you're working with line-like or plane-like things. By the end of this course, you’ll be able to answer the following questions.

            <p>
              Much of the <term>Disciplinary Practice</term>, <term>Creativity</term>, and <term>Communication and Expression</term> within mathematics comes through the process of solving a problem or proving a proposition---and then writing it up! In this class, you will develop proof writing skills to communicate math as a mathematician would.

      <p>
        This class is team-based, so you need to show up to class every day having completed the pre-class readings. Being physically present isn't enough---you need to show up ready to work! This means you also need to bring your textbook and appropriate materials for taking notes (see Showing Up (Analog Edition!) below). You can make up for a missed class by actively participating in the course Zulip (see above).

      <title>Teamwork</title>
      <p>
        Each week you will have an assignment to turn in. These assignments will give you an opportunity to write out solutions in the manner I will expect to on the exams. You will turn in your solutions at the end of class, and you will receive feedback on Gradebook. If you have not completed the assigned problems in class, the grader will give feedback on what you completed in class. You can turn in the rest of the homework after class, but it will only be checked for completion, not correctness.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, it's okay not to finish every problem assigned in class, but if you are routinely turning in much less than your peers, we will meet to figure out why before it affects your grade.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each problem on written homework should be completed with neat, understandable, detailed solutions and explanations. Your explanations and proofs must be sound and rigorous, paying attention to detail and clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Written homework is due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. It is worth 15% of your course grade. Late written homework will generally not be accepted. Since you likely will either experience a technical difficulty (e.g., missed the deadline, your computer shut down as you were submitting it, internet outage, etc.) or a personal emergency (being sick, attending a funeral, etc.) during the semester, the two lowest two written homework scores will be dropped. You do not need to contact your instructor or TA if such a situation does come up.

      <title>Proofs</title>
      <p>
        Each week you and your writing partner (a member of your team) will turn in a writing assignment. At first, these will be on paper. Eventually, they will be written in LaTeX and turned in as a PDF along with your handwritten paper notes.

        I am committed to making our classroom a lively and respectful community of thinkers. Please let me know if you feel that we are straying from this vision at any point during the semester.

            <paragraphs>
              <p>
                This class is almost completely analog; you may not use a tablet, phone, computer, or other electronic device in class unless it is a designated <q>digital day</q>. <alert>This means that you should come to class with a writing implement (plus a backup), paper for note-taking, and your textbook.</alert>
              </p>
              <p>
                By enrolling in this class, you are agreeing to be an engaged student, to come to class with a learner's attitude, and to encourage your fellow students to do the same. If you miss a class, it’s your responsibility to make up the material you missed by getting the notes from a classmate.
              </p>
              <p> 
                Because this is a team-based course, your absences will affect your team. <alert>If you prove to be an unreliable team member, you will be forced to complete the teamwork as a team of one, which will affect your course grade significantly.</alert>
              </p>
              <p>
                This class requires your tenacity and commitment to staying engaged throughout the semester. At times the assignments will be open-ended and require creativity and courage as you try solving problems that are different from those you've read about.

              There is <em>a lot of reading</em> outside of class! You'll be responsible for reading the textbook ahead of each class and showing up with questions if you have any.

            <p>
              The purpose of this course is to develop your ability to understand and construct mathematical arguments or proofs. The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools and applications (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DALL-E, Google NotebookLM and others) for work that is turned in for a grade is prohibited because it does not support the learning objectives of this course.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your professor may describe limited use-cases for Google NotebookLM, but unless it is explicitly permitted for an assignment (in writing!), you may not use it.

              <p>
                You should be familiar with Hamilton's <url href="https://www.hamilton.edu/student-handbook/studentconduct/honor-code">Honor Code</url>. Section III commits you to report violations that you witness to your professor or a member of the honor court (preferably at the moment you witness it), or giving a warning to your peer. I expect you to honor these commitments as Hamilton community members.
              </p>
              <p>
                Section II.1 discusses plagiarism. In mathematics, this includes finding a solution and using any part of it without attribution, even if you <em>could</em> have thought of the ideas on your own. This is one reason that I prohibit using unofficial online resources (like generative AI, which now includes most search engines that provide AI summaries!) for graded work. The other reason is that it's bad for your mathematical development. If you slip up and do use an unapproved resource, don't plagiarize: cite your source.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, being stumped is part of learning mathematics, and making sense of the world is part of being a human! But you belong to community of other people sharing this experience. I encourage you to seek help when you need it from appropriate resources. These include office hours, the QSR, your classmates, your professor, and materials and databases you can access through the Hamilton College library.
              </p>
              <p>
                Working with collaborators is one of the best parts of mathematics! Wen working together, make sure everyone is able to (and encouraged to) contribute.
              </p>
              <p>
                <alert>If in doubt, check with Courtney before using resources explicitly listed in this syllabus.</alert>

              <p>
                If there are other people waiting to see me, say hi, introduce yourself, and see if you have the same questions. You can work together (and I encourage you to work together!) and then I can talk to a bunch of you together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bring your professor to you. I like to go where you (and your collaborators) are working on problems together.
              </p>
              <p>
                Know the difference between collaboration (good) and copying someone else's solution (bad). Active collaboration can take many forms: asking "Why?" a lot; explaining your thinking to someone else; passing the chalk around a group of people and taking turns at the blackboard working on a problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Collaboration is one of the best parts of being a mathematician. Enjoy it! Make friends! Solve problems! Get stuck! Get unstuck!

    <title>Accommodations, Conflicts, and Rescheduled Exams.</title>
    <p>
      The only assignments that may be rescheduled are exams. Except in the case of severe illness or emergency, I need advance notice so that we can arrange a make-up midterm for you. Give me notice at least one week prior to the exam that you have an academic accommodation or a conflict due to academics, a religious observance, work, athletics, or a student organization event. The final exam is scheduled by the registrar and can be rescheduled only in very specific circumstances: travel plans home for break don’t count, but three finals on the same day do.
