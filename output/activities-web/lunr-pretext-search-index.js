Exploring Linear Systems   For each of the following prompts, first try to construct an example (or decide that one cannot exist). Then reflect on what the question reveals about linear systems. Use vocabulary from the chapter in your reflections.    Try These!    Write down an inconsistent linear system in two unknowns.   Write down an inconsistent homogeneous linear system in two unknowns, or explain why this is impossible.    Find the solution(s) to the linear system, if any exist.     Write down a nonhomogeneous linear system with the trivial solution, or explain why this is impossible.    Write down a linear system with three equations that is equivalent to the system below.     Turn-In!  Find and so that the linear system below is consistent with infinitely many solutions.         One example is   which is inconsistent because the two equations contradict one another.    No such system exists. Every homogeneous linear system has the trivial solution, so it can never be inconsistent.    Solving the system gives the unique solution     No such system exists. The trivial solution cannot satisfy a nonhomogeneous system.    One equivalent system is obtained by adding a redundant equation, such as         Reflect   Which of these questions ask for a specific example, and which are really asking you to think about what must be true of certain kinds of linear systems? What properties distinguish homogeneous and nonhomogeneous systems?  Is it possible for a linear system to have exactly three solutions? Why or why not?    Homogeneous systems by definition are linear expressions (like , without a constant term) set equal to zero. You can tell if a system is homogeneous by checking if setting all the variables equal to zero is a solution. This is because setting all the variables equal to zero makes the left size zero, and the only way for there to be an equality is if the right side is also zero.  Linear systems have one, zero, or infintely many solutions. This is a mathematical statement that we will prove later the course, but for right now, you can think about the way lines and planes can be arranged. A line can intersect another line at one point, or they can miss each other completely if they're parallel, or they can plot the exact same (infinitely many) points.     Computation Questions.   Turn-In!  For each linear system below, solve using the method of elimination to find its solutions or show that it has no solutions.  First system.   Second system.   Third system.   where is any real number. For what value(s) of is the system consistent? For what value(s) of is the system inconsistent?    First system: If we try to eliminate by multiplying the first equation by and adding this to the second equation, we arrive at the false statement . This system is therefore inconclusive. (Geometrically, these represent parallel planes in space!)  Second system: Eliminate in the second equation using the first equation to arrive at the equivalent system   We can make an equivalent system by scaling the second equation to make our lives easier.   Now eliminate from the first equation using the (new) second equation   We check to see if is a solution to the final equation, but , so the system is inconsistent.  Third system: if we try to eliminate variables, we end up with and . For this system to be consistent, we must have , and then there are infinitely many solutions   (i.e., the points on the line ).     Special Forms.   For each linear system below, try to solve without using the method of elimination.  First system.   Second system.     These are examples of substitution problems. In the first system, implies which lets us solve , and the values for and let us solve for the value of in the first equation of the system. Similarly, we can substitute to solve for , and then for and to solve for .      Adding Matrices and Scaling Matrices.   In Section 2, we see the definition of an matrix with entries for and :   This matrix has rows and columns, and is the shorthand for the set of all such matrices (we're defaulting to real entries now).    True or False?   Determine whether each statement is true or false.    It is possible that     The matrices below are equal.     There exist real numbers and such that     There exists a real number such that          False. The first matrix is while the second matrix is . Matrices of different dimensions cannot be equal.     True. Simplifying the entries gives   so the matrices are equal entry by entry.     True. Taking and makes the matrices equal.     False. Equality would require from the top-left entries and from the bottom-right entries, which is impossible.       Isolating Rows and Columns   Sometimes it's helpful to talk about a row or column of a matrix instead of the whole thing. Fill out the entries for the following based on the matrix above. A row is sometimes called a row vector and a column is sometimes called a column vector . In this class, if we say vector , we (almost always) mean a column vector.   and     and     This is a good time to review the definitions of matrix addition ( entrywise is how people talk about this sometimes), scalar multiplication, and subtraction (a combination of addition and multiplication, if you like), and transposes. What does it mean to be a zero matrix from the point of view of matrix addition? Can a matrix have an additive inverse?   Existence of the Additive Identity   The matrix of all zeros, , is the additive identity for the set of matrices.  That is for each ,     Let be positive integers. Assume , and assume is the matrix of all zeros.   Try find a way to use the definition of addition to get to the end of the proof (the next line). Since matrix equality happens at the entry level, you will probably have define and for all , , and note that for each entry. Now use the definition of addition: what is the -th entry of ?   Therefore, .    Is ? How would you prove it?  Unless is square, and have different sizes so they can't be equal. If is square (same number of rows and columns), then and have the same sizes and the same entries (all zeros), so they are equal.   Once you work those questions out, talk about the defintion of matrix multiplication . That is, explain why the following is the definition; what is the point of defining matrix multiplication this way? Probably has something to do with linear systems, right?    Practice: Matrix Operations   In Sections 2 and 3 we saw how the basic operations on matrices are defined. Let’s practice a few examples involving addition, scalar multiplication, transposes, and matrix multiplication.    Matrix Operations      Add the matrices below.     Decide whether the following sum is defined. If it is, compute it.      Compute the scalar multiple below.     Simplify the expression below.      Compute the product below, if it is defined.     Decide whether the following product is defined. If it is, compute it.    Turn-In!  What does the matrix multiplication below represent?         The matrices have the same dimensions, so addition is defined. Adding entry by entry gives     This sum is not defined. The first matrix is while the second matrix is . Matrices must have the same dimensions in order to be added.    Multiply each entry of the matrix by to obtain     Distributing the scalar gives     The product is defined, since both matrices are . Computing the product gives     The product is defined. A matrix multiplied by a matrix produces a matrix. The result is     A linear system of two equations in three variables!         Which Matrix Products Are Well-Defined?   Consider the matrices below.      Determine which of the following matrix products are well-defined . If a product is well-defined, compute it. If it is not, explain why not.          (Do you have any conjectures about ?)         is well-defined and the product is  is also well-defined but the product is (this means )  is not well-defined because has three columns but has only two rows  is well-defined  is well-definied    is well-defined and (check that you believe this! What's special about ?)   is well-defined  is well-defined and equal to the previous       Based on the previous example, determine whether each statement below is true or false. Justify your answers.     Matrix multiplication is commutative .  False! We saw above, and sometimes one is defined while the other is not!      Matrix multiplication is associative .  True! This will require a proof involving multiplying three matrices together.        Preparing for the Matrix–Vector Product Theorem   The next theorem is one of the most important tools we will use this semester. Before proving it, we will do some preliminary work to understand why it should be true.     Theorem (Matrix–Vector Product Theorem, MVP). Let   Then the product is well-defined, and       Assumptions:      Relevant definitions:   Matrix multiplication  Linear combinations  Matrix equality    Goal: Starting from the assumptions and using the relevant definitions, show that .     Finishing the Proof of the Matrix–Vector Product Theorem   Turn-In!  The proof below is partially completed. Work together to finish it. Be explicit about where each definition is used.   By the definition of matrix multiplication, the product is an matrix, and   Using the definition of matrix addition, this can be written as   By the definition of scalar multiplication, we may factor out from each term, leaving . Therefore,   as desired. QED.       More Turn-In!   In addition to the problems marked as Turn-In above, you should do the following questions and turn them in with your group on ONE piece of paper with EVERYONE's name. It's okay if you don't quite finish all of these in class.  I recommend trying them outside of class if you don't finish, though you don't need to turn them in.
