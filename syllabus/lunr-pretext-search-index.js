  "body": " Linear Algebra  MATH-224W     Courtney Gibbons Department of Mathematics and Statistics Hamilton College  Last Updated:          Course Information     Course Description  Linear Algebra is about how lots of lines and planes (and things that generalize a lot of features of lines and planes) behave at the same time, and the types of mathematical operations that can be defined when you're working with line-like or plane-like things. By the end of this course, you’ll be able to answer the following questions.    What are the tools for solving systems of linear equations?    What is the fundamental structure of the algebra of matrices?    How can we characterize invertible matrices?    What are vector spaces and how can we describe them?    How can we tell when two vector spaces are the same?    What are the geometric properties of vector spaces and linear transformations?    And, finally, how do we communicate the answers to questions like these using formal mathematical writing?      Educational Goals  Much of the Disciplinary Practice , Creativity , and Communication and Expression within mathematics comes through the process of solving a problem or proving a proposition---and then writing it up! In this class, you will develop proof writing skills to communicate math as a mathematician would.    Designations  Writing Intensive    Prerequisite  MATH-116 Calculus 2    Other Characteristics  Analog: No computers or tablets (or other devices) in class except for specified digital days   Flipped: You will be responsible for reading and reviewing the textbook outside of class. In class, you will solve problems.  Team-based: You will work with a team all semester to complete in-class graded work.       Meeting Times and Locations  We meet promptly Tuesday and Thursday 9-10:15 am in C.J. 222.   You need to be here on time because you will be part of a team in this course.     What We Do in Class  This class meets for two 75-minute periods per week. You will do readings outside of class. You will do teamwork and writing assignments in class for a grade.     Course Staff   Professor   Dr. Courtney Gibbons   My pronouns are she\/her\/hers. I ask that you address me as Prof. Gibbons or Courtney , the appropriate professional forms. Since this is not high school, please do not address me as Ms. , Miss , or Mrs. Gibbons .      Title  Associate Professor of Mathematics Director of the Data Science Program Committee Cat and Small Child Wrangler     Email   crgibbon@hamilon.edu         QSR Support      Facilitated Group Study  Our course tutor will be hosting small group sessions outside of class on QSR content. The tutor will contact the students in class via email to determine the best times to host these sessions. Students must complete the survey if they have any interest in participating.  Assigned QSR Tutor: Tillman Peters   tppeters@hamilton.edu     Drop-in Hours (CJ 301\/303)    Sunday 4:00 - 9:00 pm    Monday 1:00 - 9:00 pm    Tuesday 1:00 - 9:00 pm    Wednesday 1:00 - 9:00 pm    Thursday 1:00 - 9:00 pm    Friday 1:00 - 4:00 pm          Office Hours  Please drop by my office hours! No appointment is needed. An up-to-date calendar is available on Google calendar and you can add it to your calendar app if you like: Courtney's Office Hours Calendar      Textbook and Other Required Materials     Textbook  The required course text Elementary Linear Algebra with Applications (Classic Version) by Bernard Kolman and David Hill. You will need to bring your book to class with you! You can find more information about the book at the Hamilton bookstore . You may find the book for a better price elsewhere; I will provide the first chapter on Blackboard in case yours takes a little time to make it to you.     Blackboard  All course materials will appear on Blackboard.    Gradescope  Generally, you will submit your teamwork and writing assignments at the end of class or via Gradescope, and they will be graded and returned to via Gradescope. Exams and the final exam will be taken on paper, but I will upload them to Gradescope and you will access your graded version there. The final exam will not be returned to you, but you can come by to review it with me the following semester. You will be able to access Gradescope using links from Blackboard.    Zulip  We will use Zulip as a forum for you to discuss the material of this class with other students, our assigned tutor(s), and me, your professor! Posts to this page should be confined to questions regarding the material and logistical questions about the class (e.g., exam dates and locations).  Keep it professional and positive, please.       Assessments   Engagement  This class is team-based, so you need to show up to class every day having completed the pre-class readings. Being physically present isn't enough---you need to show up ready to work! This means you also need to bring your textbook and appropriate materials for taking notes (see Showing Up (Analog Edition!) below). You can make up for a missed class by actively participating in the course Zulip (see above).    Teamwork  Each week you will have an assignment to turn in. These assignments will give you an opportunity to write out solutions in the manner I will expect to on the exams. You will turn in your solutions at the end of class, and you will receive feedback on Gradebook. If you have not completed the assigned problems in class, the grader will give feedback on what you completed in class. You can turn in the rest of the homework after class, but it will only be checked for completion, not correctness.  In general, it's okay not to finish every problem assigned in class, but if you are routinely turning in much less than your peers, we will meet to figure out why before it affects your grade.  Each problem on written homework should be completed with neat, understandable, detailed solutions and explanations. Your explanations and proofs must be sound and rigorous, paying attention to detail and clarity.  Written homework is due Thursday nights at 11:59pm CT. It is worth 15% of your course grade. Late written homework will generally not be accepted. Since you likely will either experience a technical difficulty (e.g., missed the deadline, your computer shut down as you were submitting it, internet outage, etc.) or a personal emergency (being sick, attending a funeral, etc.) during the semester, the two lowest two written homework scores will be dropped. You do not need to contact your instructor or TA if such a situation does come up.    Proofs  Each week you and your writing partner (a member of your team) will turn in a writing assignment. At first, these will be on paper. Eventually, they will be written in LaTeX and turned in as a PDF along with your handwritten paper notes.    Exams  The dates and times for the exams are:   Midterm 1  Tuesday, March 3, in class; a 15-minute oral one-on-one component will be scheduled outside of class time.    Midterm 2  Thursday, April 30, in class; a 15-minute oral one-on-one component will be scheduled outside of class time.    Final Exam  Math common exam time (TBA).        Grading  The grade components and their are all identified above. For quick reference, they are also summarized in the table below.    Component  Weight    Attendance  10%    Teamwork  10%    Writing Assignments  10%    Midterm 1  25%    Midterm 2  25%    Final Exam  20%    Grades will not be rounded up to the next integer. The lower cutoff for each letter grade is given in the table below. It is possible that these cutoffs will be adjusted at the end of the semester. However, if this is done, it will only be done in a way that benefits students by lowering the cutoff to earn a given letter grade.     Letter Grade  Lower Cutoff    A  94%    A-  90%    B+  87%    B  84%    B-  80%    C+  77%    C  74%    C-  70%    D  60%    F  0%      Our Responsibilities   The American Mathematical Society (the largest professional society for mathematicians) outlines its vision for a welcoming environment as follows:   The AMS strives to ensure that participants in its activities enjoy a welcoming environment. In all its activities, the AMS seeks to foster an atmosphere that encourages the free expression and exchange of ideas. The AMS supports equality of opportunity and treatment for all participants, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, race, color, national or ethnic origin, religion or religious belief, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disabilities, veteran status, or immigration status.... A commitment to a welcoming environment is expected of all attendees at AMS activities, including mathematicians, students, guests, staff, contractors and exhibitors, and participants in scientific sessions and social events.   I am committed to making our classroom a lively and respectful community of thinkers. Please let me know if you feel that we are straying from this vision at any point during the semester.     Your Responsibilities  (or, How to Be a Good Mathematics Learner and Uphold the Honor Code)      Showing Up (Analog Edition!)   This class is almost completely analog; you may not use a tablet, phone, computer, or other electronic device in class unless it is a designated digital day . This means that you should come to class with a writing implement (plus a backup), paper for note-taking, and your textbook.   By enrolling in this class, you are agreeing to be an engaged student, to come to class with a learner's attitude, and to encourage your fellow students to do the same. If you miss a class, it’s your responsibility to make up the material you missed by getting the notes from a classmate.  Because this is a team-based course, your absences will affect your team. If you prove to be an unreliable team member, you will be forced to complete the teamwork as a team of one, which will affect your course grade significantly.   This class requires your tenacity and commitment to staying engaged throughout the semester. At times the assignments will be open-ended and require creativity and courage as you try solving problems that are different from those you've read about.    Reading and Writing  There is a lot of reading outside of class! You'll be responsible for reading the textbook ahead of each class and showing up with questions if you have any.   AI Policy   The purpose of this course is to develop your ability to understand and construct mathematical arguments or proofs. The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools and applications (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DALL-E, Google NotebookLM and others) for work that is turned in for a grade is prohibited because it does not support the learning objectives of this course.  Your professor may describe limited use-cases for Google NotebookLM, but unless it is explicitly permitted for an assignment (in writing!), you may not use it.     The Honor Code and Getting Stuck   You should be familiar with Hamilton's Honor Code . Section III commits you to report violations that you witness to your professor or a member of the honor court (preferably at the moment you witness it), or giving a warning to your peer. I expect you to honor these commitments as Hamilton community members.  Section II.1 discusses plagiarism. In mathematics, this includes finding a solution and using any part of it without attribution, even if you could have thought of the ideas on your own. This is one reason that I prohibit using unofficial online resources (like generative AI, which now includes most search engines that provide AI summaries!) for graded work. The other reason is that it's bad for your mathematical development. If you slip up and do use an unapproved resource, don't plagiarize: cite your source.  Remember, being stumped is part of learning mathematics, and making sense of the world is part of being a human! But you belong to community of other people sharing this experience. I encourage you to seek help when you need it from appropriate resources. These include office hours, the QSR, your classmates, your professor, and materials and databases you can access through the Hamilton College library.  Working with collaborators is one of the best parts of mathematics! Wen working together, make sure everyone is able to (and encouraged to) contribute.   If in doubt, check with Courtney before using resources explicitly listed in this syllabus.      Using Office Hours Productively   If there are other people waiting to see me, say hi, introduce yourself, and see if you have the same questions. You can work together (and I encourage you to work together!) and then I can talk to a bunch of you together.  Bring your professor to you. I like to go where you (and your collaborators) are working on problems together.  Know the difference between collaboration (good) and copying someone else's solution (bad). Active collaboration can take many forms: asking \"Why?\" a lot; explaining your thinking to someone else; passing the chalk around a group of people and taking turns at the blackboard working on a problem.  Collaboration is one of the best parts of being a mathematician. Enjoy it! Make friends! Solve problems! Get stuck! Get unstuck!
